## Neuron model optimization

This repository contains my personal code for data-driven optimization of multi-compartment neuron models.

The code assumes a certain data structure and therefore might not be readily usable with other folder structures.

Please contact me at danielelinaro@gmail.com should you be interested in using the code.
