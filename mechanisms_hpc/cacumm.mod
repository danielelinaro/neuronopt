COMMENT
	calcium accumulation into a volume of area*depth next to the
	membrane with a decay (time constant tau) to resting level
	given by the global calcium variable cai0_ca_ion
	Modified to include a resting current (irest) and peak value
	(cmax)
	i is a dummy current needed to force a BREAKPOINT
ENDCOMMENT

COMMENT
        added parameter gamma to model the percentage of free calcium,
        similarly to what is done in the CaDynamics_E2 mechanism, which
        is itself a modified version of Destexhe et al., 1994.
